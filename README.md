2. Navigate into the tool's folder:

   cd forgeclip
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Python** (Tkinter, PyQt, Flask, Watchdog, etc.)
- **Electron.js** (for GUI tools if cross-platform is needed)
- **SQLite** and **JSON** for fast, local storage
- Targeting **Windows first**, with future Linux/macOS support planned

---

## 📦 Installation & Usage

> ⚠️ Coming soon: prebuilt installers and detailed docs for each tool

For now, clone the repo and run tools individually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ToolForge.git
cd ToolForge/forgeclip
python main.py
```

Dependencies will be listed in each tool’s `requirements.txt`.

## 🧾 Versioning

ToolForge uses **semantic, time-based versioning**:

```
<YY>.<MX>.<P>
```

- `YY` – Year (`25` for 2025)
- `MX` – Major milestone (new feature sets or UI changes)
- `P`  – Patch number (fixes, improvements)

See `VERSION.md` for full version history and roadmap.
